# Mars Monitor

Computer vision system for the Raspberry Pi designed to read the progress information from an Elegoo Mars 5 screen.

## Installation

Clone this repo, then:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If testing on Windows, you'll also need a copy of tesseract placed in the same directory as `mars_monitor.py`, it's available from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

## Usage

### Hardware

The Raspberry Pi camera must be positioned directly in front of the printer's display at a distance that lets the camera focus.

Inside the `assets/` directory is an STL for a bracket that will hold a full-size Pi (i.e. not a Zero) and an official Raspberry Pi camera module and slot beneath the printer is provided:

### Software

Status update notifications use the https://ntfy.sh/ service. To receive notifications, install this on your mobile device and set up your custom topic (see https://docs.ntfy.sh/#step-1-get-the-app)

Edit the `config.json` file to include your topic URL:

```json
{
    "ntfy_url": "https://ntfy.sh/YOUR-TOPIC"
}
```

Then run the application with `python mars_monitor.py` and you'll receive status update notifications every 30 minutes.

You may want to set `mars_monitor.py` to run automatically at boot, but nstructions on how to do this are beyond the scope of this document.


## Screenshots

## To do:

1. Capture image from Pi camera
2. Extract progress %
3. Recognise error
4. Flask webapp to host latest capture
